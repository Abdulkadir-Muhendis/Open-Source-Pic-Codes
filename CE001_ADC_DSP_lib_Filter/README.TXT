      Readme for Example dsPIC30F Workspace and Project
     ---------------------------------------------------

This file provides a brief description of files and folders provided
in the accompanying workspace.

This folder contains the following files:
1. DS92001.pdf
        This file provides a description of the functionality demonstr-
        ated by the example source code.

2. ADC_DSP_lib_Filter.mcp, ADC_DSP_lib_Filter.mcw,
   ADC_DSP_lib_Filter.mcs
        These are MPLAB® IDE workspace and project files that may be
        used to examine, build, program and debug the example source
        code.


This folder contains the following sub-folders:
1. PC Simulation:
        dsPIC Filter Design sub-folder-
        This folder contains two file types - *.spc and *.s.
        The *.spc file is a filter specification file that may be
        opened within dsPIC Filter Design and dsPIC Filter Design Lite
        software. When opened, this file presents a filter design
        wizard that helps the user design the coefficients for the
        filter used in this code example. The *.s file is a dsPIC30F
        assembler source file generated by dsPIC Filter Design
        software. This file contains filter coefficients and state
        variable definitions used in the example project.

        dsPICworks sub-folder-
        This folder contains time and frequency data files generated
        by simulating the filtering algorithm within dsPICworks
        using the filter generated by dsPIC Filter Design.

        screenshots-
        This folder contains screenshots taken from dsPIC Filter Design
        and dsPICworks for the input and output waveforms as well as
        the response of the filter.

2. gld
        This folder contains a linker script file for the example project.
        This file is used for building the project for a 30F6014A device.
        This file simply includes the relevant device linker script, 
        "p30F6014A.gld" and the relevant MPLAB® C30 library files, 
        "libdsp-coff.a", "libc-coff.a", and "libm-coff.a" or 
        "libdsp-elf.a", "libc-elf.a", and "libm-elf.a" from their installed 
        location. 

3. h
        This folder contains C header files useful in building this
        project. Device register and bit definitions are provided in
        the "p30F6014A.h" file, which may be found in the installation folder
        of the MPLAB® C30 toolsuite.

4. hex
        This folder contains three file types - coff, hex and map.
        These are files generated by the MPLAB® C30 toolsuite on build
        operation performed within MPLAB® IDE. The *.map file contains
        details on memory allocation for various variables, constants
        and dsPIC30F instructions specified in the source and library
        code. The *.hex file contains a binary file that may be
        programmed into the dsPIC30F device. The *.coff file contains
        a binary file that is used by MPLAB® IDE for simulation.

5. source
        This folder contains all the C and Assembler source files (*.c,
        *.s) used in demonstrating the described example. This folder
        also contains a sub-folder named "obj" that stores compiled
        object files generated when the project is built.
